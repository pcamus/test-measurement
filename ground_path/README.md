## Ground path issue when connecting several USB devices.

In the hardware setup section we have noticed a unexpected behavior :

> Before connecting the logic analyser ground connection, the measured current was 18.6 mA when the LED is off and 20.7 mA when it is on.
> 
> When I connected the ground wire, these values changed a lot.
