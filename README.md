## Test & measurement on embedded systems.

In this repository, I will give setups of measurement platforms aimed to embedded systems.

I will focus on two kinds of measurement : power consumption and timing of ÂµC generated signals (by hardware interfaces or by bit banging).

The purpose of these tests is to study autonomy of an embedded system and to highlight realtime issues.

- [Ground path issues](ground_path)
